# Pac-Man Game Project

## Introduction
This project is an implementation of the classic Pac-Man game using the C programming language. The goal of the project is to create a simple and playable version of Pac-Man that demonstrates the fundamentals of game programming.

## Game Features
The Pac-Man game implemented in this project includes the following features:

1. **Menu and Game Controls**: The game provides a menu with options to start the game, view high scores, and exit the game. The player can control Pac-Man's movement using the arrow keys or WASD keys.

2. **Maze and Ghosts**: The game features a maze-like level design with various pellets and power-ups scattered throughout. The player must navigate Pac-Man through the maze while avoiding the ghosts that roam the level.

4. **Scoring and Lives**: The player earns points by collecting pellets and power-ups. The game also keeps track of the player's high scores and the number of lives remaining.

5. **Difficulty Levels**: The game offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Hard. The difficulty affects factors such as the speed of the ghosts, the number of pellets, and the number of lives.

7. **Visual Effects**: The game includes various visual effects, such as animated sprites for Pac-Man and the ghosts, as well as sound effects for player actions and events.

## Getting Started
To run the Pac-Man game, you will need to have a C compiler installed on your system. The project can be compiled and executed using the following steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the project files in your preferred code editor.
3. Compile the C source code using your compiler.
4. Run the compiled executable to start the Pac-Man game.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- `src/`: Contains the C source code files for the game.
- `include/`: Contains the header files for the game.
- `assets/`: Contains the game assets.
- `images/`: Contains the images.
- `sounds/`: Contains the sound files.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the game.
