# Pac-Man Game Project

## Introduction
This project is an implementation of the classic Pac-Man game using the C programming language. The goal of the project is to create a simple and playable version of Pac-Man that demonstrates the fundamentals of game programming.

## Game Features
The Pac-Man game implemented in this project includes the following features:

1. **Menu and Game Controls**: The game provides a menu with options to start the game, view high scores, and exit the game. The player can control Pac-Man's movement using the arrow keys or WASD keys.

2. **Maze and Ghosts**: The game features a maze-like level design with various pellets and power-ups scattered throughout. The player must navigate Pac-Man through the maze while avoiding the ghosts that roam the level.

3. **Scoring and Lives**:Players earn points by collecting pellets and power-ups.
The game keeps track of the player's high scores and the number of lives remaining.
Scoreboard: A dedicated scoreboard displays the current score, high scores, and the number of lives left. Players can view their progress and compare their scores against previous games.

4. **Fruits and Power-ups**: In addition to regular pellets, the game includes special fruits that appear at random intervals.
Collecting these fruits grants extra points and sometimes additional bonuses, enhancing gameplay and encouraging exploration of the maze.



5. **Difficulty Levels**:The game offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Hard.
The difficulty affects factors such as the speed of the ghosts, the number of pellets, and the number of lives available to the player.

6. **Visual Effects**: The game includes various visual effects, such as animated sprites for Pac-Man and the ghosts, as well as sound effects for player actions and events.

## Getting Started
To run the Pac-Man game, you will need to have a C compiler installed on your system. The project can be compiled and executed using the following steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the project files in your preferred code editor.
3. Compile the C source code using your compiler.
4. Run the compiled executable to start the Pac-Man game.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- `src/`: Contains the C source code files for the game.
- `include/`: Contains the header files for the game.
- `assets/`: Contains the game assets.
- `images/`: Contains the images.
- `sounds/`: Contains the sound files.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the game.
